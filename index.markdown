I am an interdisciplinary researcher in data science (NLP/ML/AI), with a background in psychotherapy and philosophy of science. I develop technical solutions that address epistemological and sociotechnical problems. For my Master of Arts and Sciences at the London Interdisciplinary School (2024–2025), I wrote a dissertation on **AI slop**, which relates to fields such as misinformation and academic integrity.

## Featured Projects

**What is AI slop?**

Master's dissertation ([abstract](/assets/pdfs/capstone_abstract.pdf)). Research that investigates AI slop using thematic analysis, topic modelling and statistical linguistic features. Outlines the types, themes, metaphors, and qualities of slop. Also finds that slop news is less varied and more positive than human-written high-quality news. A version of it is published as a [series of blog posts](https://simulacro.co.uk/introduction-to-slop-studies/).
