I am an interdisciplinary researcher in natural language processing and AI ethics, with a background in psychotherapy and philosophy of science. I am currently pursuing a **Master of Arts and Sciences** at the London Interdisciplinary School (2024-2025).

I study epistemological and sociotechnical dimensions of machine learning, currently focusing on the emerging phenomenon of **AI slop**, which is related to fields such as misinformation and academic integrity. [Download my resume here](/assets/pdfs/cv_gustavo_costa.pdf).
