I'm **Gustavo Costa**, an interdisciplinary researcher in data science and AI ethics, transitioning from a background in psychotherapy and philosophy of science.

I study epistemological and sociotechnical dimensions of machine learning, currently focusing on the emerging phenomenon of **AI slop**, which ties into misinformation, academic integrity, and technical responsible NLP.
