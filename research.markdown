## Research Focus

My research sits at the intersection of **data science, AI ethics, and philosophy of science**. I study the epistemological and sociotechnical dimensions of machine learning, with a particular focus on the emerging phenomenon of **AI slop**.

## Current Research

### Dissertation: "What is AI slop?" _2024-2025_

**London Interdisciplinary School, MASc in Interdisciplinary Problems and Methods**

Exploring the concept of AI slop - low-quality, mass-produced AI-generated content that floods digital spaces. This research examines:

-   Sociotechnical dimensions of content quality
-   Philosophical frameworks for understanding AI slop (e.g. philosophy of bullshit)
-   Thematic analysis and topic modelling of texts about AI slop
-   Statistical analysis of textual characteristics of AI slop (less variable, more positive than human-written)
