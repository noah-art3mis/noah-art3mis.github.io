## Current Research

### Dissertation: "What is AI slop?" _2024-2025_

Exploring the concept of AI slop - low-quality, mass-produced AI-generated content that floods digital spaces. This research examines:

-   Sociotechnical dimensions of content quality
-   Philosophical frameworks for understanding AI slop (e.g. philsophy of bullshit)
-   Thematic analysis and topic modelling of texts about AI slop
-   Statistical analysis of textual characteristics of AI slop (less variable, more positive than human-written)
